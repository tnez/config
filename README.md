# config

My peronsal dotfile / config collection.

## How this works

All my configs and dotfiles live in the `~/.config` so I can neatly wrangle everything into a single version controlled location. Each software gets its own directory and files will be symlinked to wherever they need to exist in the filesystem (most often into my home directory) for all the things to work :pray:
